# Homework 1 (Due 9/21)
## Problem 1
Suppose the instance space $X$ is the set of real numbers  $X = R$,  and  $H$  the  set  of intervals on the real number line, i.e., $H$  is the set of hypotheses of the form $a < x < b$, where a and b are any real constants. What is $VC(H)$?

### Answer :
Set of size 2 can be shattered. (there are only a single block of positive examples in the interval)
Now consider three point case : $p_1,\ p_2,\ p_3$ where $p_1\le p_2\le p_3$ ,and these points are labeled +, - , + respectively.

We can't slide the intervals (a, b) s.t. only $p_1$ fall in the interval. thus, $VC(H)$ = 2

## Problem 2
Each point can be labeled in 2 ways as +/–. Show that for any finite $H$ , $VC(H) \le log_2 |H|$

### Answer:

For any set $C$, we have $|H_c| \le |H|$, and $C$ can't be shattered if $|H|<2^{|C|}$ $\to VC(H) \le log_2 |H|$
